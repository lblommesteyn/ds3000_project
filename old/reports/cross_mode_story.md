# Cross-Mode Propagation Story (2025)

- Focus station: **Kennedy** with the heaviest surface ripple.
- On **2025-07-30**, Kennedy triggered 11 linked bus/streetcar incidents adding 243.0 minutes of surface delay (see `reports/figures/story_timeline.png`).
- The most surface-prone subway cause is **PUSSW - TRACK SWITCH FAILURE  S/E/C RELATED PROBLEM**, averaging 8.8 downstream delay minutes per incident (`reports/figures/story_cause_breakdown.png`).
- Surface ripple intensity peaks around **Thursday 05:00**, with 52 linked events in that slot (`reports/figures/story_ripple_heatmap.png`).
- **Bayview** is slowest to recover, with surface delays lingering 45.0 minutes on average (`reports/figures/story_recovery.png`).

These visuals highlight where a subway disruption cascades onto surface routes and how long riders stay affected.
